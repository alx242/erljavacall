DESCRIPTION
===========

Allows calls from erlang using message passing towards a specific java
class/service...

Building:
$> javac -classpath ".:/usr/lib/erlang/lib/jinterface-1.5.8/priv/OtpErlang.jar:/usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/jinterface-1.4.2/priv/OtpErlang.jar" ErlCallNode.java

Example of launcher:
ErlCallNode foo@server service erlang

Remember that the cookie needs to be shared between the nodes, example:
erl -sname bar@server -setcookie cookie_name
or
erlang:set_cookie('cookie_name'). within a shell

This should now be possible if everything is well:
$> net:ping('foo@server')
pong

Send a message to this server:
{'mailbox_name', 'foo@server'} ! {self(), Command, Args}
